            Text("A couple of days after the UK experienced one of the hottest days on record I met my mate in Deptford during a rainy Saturday afternoon to invent a new pub crawl, which we’ve named Deptford Hop (checkout our Facebook page). I’ve been a South Londoner all my life but Deptford with it’s fascinating history and quirky charm has generally alluded me, besides the odd visit or passing through on the way to somewhere else.\n\nMy friends and I have enjoyed a few London pub crawls over the years and when one of my beer comrades told me of the new bars and micro breweries springing up in and around the Deptford High street area plus suggesting we should visit them and perhaps invent a new crawl, I was well up for it.\n\nWe met at The Full Nelson, a small veggie/vegan bar and kitchen on the main road (Deptford Broadway). I’ve been here before and so it was really nice to enjoy the place again, unfortunately we couldn’t stay long due to having 15 bars and 2 breweries on our list! But I’m sure to visit this funky little bar again in the future and I recommend it to others. \n\nNext up was BA.RN on the other side of the road. This is an interesting take on BBQ and beer, the irony certainly wasn’t lost on us - opening a very meat inspired bar opposite the vegan place! It is an equally nice place and the friendly staff invited us to sit at the bar on extremely high chairs, it’s a fun quirky place that definitely deserves a revisit. They have the excellent FourPure beer on tap too (my favourite, along with The Kernal, on the Bermondsey Mile). \n\nJust on the corner to Deptford High Street is Heaps, but unfortunately it wasn’t open at the time we visited so on to the forth, next door, Stockton. A bright and clean, chilled out little cafe/bar. Once again friendly staff greeted us and it is here I had my first taste of the excellent Villages beer, a local brewery on our list to visit later in the afternoon. Stockton is the younger sister of Buster Mantis, another bar on our list too. \n\nBig John’s up next, which is a tiny, exceedingly charming place, the owners and staff were very welcoming and the spicy biltong is a reason to visit alone, if not then it’s beautiful decanters on display and attention to detail that gives this little gem a lovely homely feel. I will definitely visit again. \n\nNext on our list, Deptford Does Art, was also closed unfortunately. So on to the 7th instead, Isla Ray. Again a groovy little bar / cafe, with a really nice colourfully decorated garden out the back which successfully achieves a chilled, relaxing area giving a feeling you are miles away from Deptford High Street. The excellent Villages beer on tap again too. \n\nSo on to our first Brewery, Little Faith, wow what a great choice of beers, and some real crackers too. Very friendly staff again, happily and proudly informing us about their selection. Very pleased to hear that their beers we sampled will be in cans soon too, I noticed a fine selection of guest beers too, including The Kernal! We drank in the bar, but outside was a large yard that looked nice and busy, with both music and food being served up. I highly recommend a visit. \n\nFrom one tap room to The Taproom. I’d visited The Taproom in Woolwich on another pub crawl and totally fell in love with their beer and pizzas! So was really looking forward to this visit. This was the only bar we ordered a flight each, we selected six different beers and of course ordered a chorizo pizza, all didn’t fail us. Shame all six were guest beers as Hop Stuff do have fine beers, but nonetheless I highly recommend a visit, a very similar cool vibe to the Woolwich Taproom. \n\nWe had now left the high street behind and was in an area called Deptford Market Yard, a really pleasant new pedestrian space, The Taproom dominates one end but lots of small independent businesses have found homes in the small arches under Deptford Station Carriage Ramp, an historic carriage ramp completed in 1835 (restored in 2015). Four more venues on our list could be found here. \n\nAAJA Bar, what a great little bar, with a live streaming DJ and good selection of drinks. It was busy inside and outside. All along the yard every bar has seating outside. Jars Bar a few doors along was the next hop stop, a brand new bar and it was nice to meet the owners and staff who are very friendly and told us of their plans for the future, finally I went for a Kernal beer, a Porter actually, that I’d never had before, really nice. On to Little Nan’s Bar next, another quirky small space, packed to the arches with bits and bobs, the antiques wall perhaps a nod to all of our Nan’s well organised homes, a fun bar filled with bonkers stuff! Dirty Apron was on our list too but unfortunately it was closed, my friend highly recommends it though. The Market Yard is definitely a neat little area, but the time had come to return to the high street. \n\n14th on our list was The Job Centre. Yep a bar named after an employment agency that once stood on the site. A very large pub but with a small bar attitude, friendly with a quirky furnished space. We sat in the garden area that has wonderful wall art. We actually returned the same evening to listen to the DJ. \n\nWith only three places left to visit on our little trail perhaps it was time for a craft beer rest and so we headed for Gin & Beer. I’m really not a Gin drinker but the staff were excellent and found a lovely gin for me. Another really cool space, sophistication meets artisan, a really nice bar. Nice place for a date I reckon. \n\nSo on to the Stockton’s big brother, Buster Mantis, another really stylish space, these last three places are situated on Resolution Way and the railway arches are a lot taller than the Market Yard ones, so the space feels grand in comparison. Another cool vibe and definitely worth a visit, a nice contrast to the sister place! \n\nAnd finally we get to one of the stars of Deptford, Villages Brewery. It’s possibly the beer that gets this place a top billing, as it’s much the same as any other brewery you would’ve visited. Their beer had followed us around all day, so it was nice to finally see its home. Another wonderful selection of beer and we sat outside again even as the warm evening was drawing to a close. \n\nSo to sum up, a wonderful little crawl / hop through a very tiny area of a busy, interesting, quirky, historic piece of South London. I highly recommend a visit to all the places above and no doubt more will be added in the future, Deptford feels like it is well and truly now on the map. I will return soon!")
